# Monty Program - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

**The Monty program is an interpreter for Monty Bytecode files  
It uses the C stack and queues to implement LIFO (last in, first out) and FIFO (first in, first out) functionalities.**

There are two implementations of both data structures
	Static(use of arrays)
	Dynamic(use of linked list)
in this project the latter will be implemeted
